# TablaM: A relational language #

**IN EXPERIMENTAL STAGE. NOT USE FOR REAL WORK**

### Code ###

[https://github.com/Tablam/TablaM/](https://github.com/Tablam/TablaM/)

### Long term goals ###

* Build a practical general language but *tailored* for data-manipulation and database coding (in the broad sense of the word).
* Become a spiritual attempt at the dbase/foxpro family of database-oriented languages, in the sense manipulate data(bases) is natural and integrated.
* Have an in-memory relational/vector-oriented structure as the main object, and facilities to provide a relational interface for custom objects/data 
  (like for example, RDBMS, the file system, csv, json, etc).
* Could be kind of similar to kdb+ but far less cryptic.
* Be good not only for developers, but also for database end-users to explore and interface with data.
* Work on OSX, Linux, Windows, iOS, Android
* Easy to embed in other languages?

### Contribution guidelines ###
